          My research interests lie in the intersection of control theory, game
          theory and cyber-physical systems.  My thesis was on extending routing
          game models to Markov Decision Processes (MDP) to study competition
          between ride-sharing drivers as well as several other game theoretic
          models in transportation.  At UW, I worked on extensions of the game
          theory models in my thesis as well as other aspects of learning in games.
          I also collaborated with Prof. Behcet Ackimese and his team on trajectory
          planning algorithms using convex optimization.

        <b> Markov Decision Process Congestion Games </b>
        <p>
        <b> Technical Summary: </b>
        <p>
        We extend traditional routing game models to scenarios where agents are solving
        Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) as opposed to shortest path problems.
        These models essentially replace the shortest path of objective of agents
        in a routing game with a stochastic shortest path objective.  Our work presents
        this model in both the finite and infinite horizon cases and serves as a
        bridge between routing games and mean-field games on graphs, bringing
        stochastic network transitions into the routing game framework and extending
        traditional routing game concepts such as price of anarchy and Braess paradox
        to the mean-field game setup.

        <b> Population Games with Continuous-Type Preferences </b>
        <p>
        <b> Technical Summary: </b>
        <p>
        Traditional population games consider only populations
        that are fully uniform, ie. all agents are the same.  We extend this framework
        to situations where populations are modeled as a mass distribution (measure)
        over a "type space".  The location of each agent (or their infinitesimal bit of mass)
        in the type space indicates that agent's relative preference for various
        options available to them.  The type space has dimension equal to the options available.
        We consider both the one dimensional case, where all options can be compared on one axis;
        and the multi-dimensional case where we can model relative preferences among many options.
        We formulate the appropriate equilibrium concept for these population games and
        show how this equilibrium can be computed via a potential function.  We
        are currently studying the dual of this potential optimization problem and
        it's interpretation.
        </p>

        <b> Applications: </b>
        <p>
        This framework combines smoothly with traditional congestion game notions and we
        use it to model hetergeneous populations making transportation choices between
        disparate options such as driving, walking, biking, or taking various forms of
        public transit.

        <b> Braess Paradox: An Algebraic Graph Theory Characterization </b>
        <p>
        <b> Technical Summary: </b>
        Braess paradox is the (in)famous phenomena in routing games where
        adding roads to a congested network can actually make congestion worse
        due to the competitive nature of traffic flow.  In this work, we provide
        an in-depth algebraic characterization of this network phenomena in terms
        of the graph incidence and Laplacian matrices.  We also present a graph
        theoretic exposition of several classical results about Braess paradox; in
        particular that Braess paradox cannot occur in a series-parallel network.
        Our current work is extending these results to hypergraphs which covers the case
        of Braess paradox in MDP congestion games.

      <b> Parking Congestion Games </b>
      <p>
      <b> Technical Summary: </b>
      We add competition for optimal parking spots to routing game models.
      Our model combines traditional routing game notions with queue theory to
      formulate a congestion game and corresponding Wardrop equilibrium notion.
      We then solve this potential game via the appropriate potential function.

    <b> Stability of Learning Strategies in Continuous Games </b>
    <p>
    <b> Technical Summary: </b>
    We apply stability notions from linear system theory to study learning
    dynamics in two-player games with continuous action sets.  We present a
    complete picture of when gradient play is stable (and unstable) in the scalar
    action case (2x2 game Jacobians). Though straightforward, these results
    provide much qualitative insight into learning dynamics in different types of
    games such as potential games, zero-sum games, etc.  We then generalize some
    of these results to the vector action case.
